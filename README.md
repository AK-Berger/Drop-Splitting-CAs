# Drop-Splitting-CAs
The toolkit is particularly useful for studying drop impact on edged structures, providing insights into how surface wettability and impact velocity affect the behavior of the drops. This script can be applied to similar experiments for accurate and efficient measurement of contact angles and drop dynamics.
